## My-Portfolio (RRD)
I built this project to practice React fundamentals, component structure, and React Router.
The portfolio includes sections like Home, About, Projects, Contact, and Footer.
Through this project, I improved my understanding of UI layout, reusable components, and basic frontend best practices.

## What I Used
- React for building UI components
- React Router DOM for page navigation
- Tailwind CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript for logic handling

## How Everything Is Connected
The app uses React Router to manage navigation between pages.
A MainLayout component is used to keep Header and Footer fixed.
The <Outlet /> component renders different pages like Home, About, Projects, and Contact inside the layout.

## Component Structure
Components are divided into reusable sections like Header and Footer.
Pages like Home, About, Projects, and Contact are kept separate for clarity.
This structure makes the project easier to understand and maintain.

## Learning Outcome
- Understood how routing works in a React application
- Learned how to reuse layouts using Outlet
- Improved confidence in component-based thinking

## Note
This portfolio is part of my frontend learning journey.
I will keep improving it as I learn more React concepts.
